 alt-text: "Two figures (the Checker Shadow Illusion and an equivalent illusion) demonstrate the phenomenon of simultaneous contrast: objects with the same intensity of light can be perceived as beeing different colors, due to context. Squares A and B have the same hue of color, although they do not seem so; they are perceived as different in color. When changing the contrast it is then possible to see that they have the same color!" # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "To perceive it is necessary to understand the role that our experiences play and how they are articulated with the biological mechanisms of information processing with which we come to the world. Perceiving is a complex process that is built from repeated exposure of our sensors to the response of the physical world with which we interact since we were born. In this chapter we will highlight this complex process based on the general functioning of our sensory processing, to then focus on the example of vision. It will deepen specific aspects of vision such as movement perception, of color or depth, to finally address the general problem that involves the necessary integration of the information that it is processed in different areas of the brain for the conformation of a single perception."
